# Klyp Developers Test
I have created a WordPress plugin which fetches movies that start with red, green, blue and yellow and displays them on any page that has this shortcode **[klyptest]**.  
What I have used:
- WordPress as CMS
- jQuery for making AJAX requets.
- Gulp
- WordPress transients to store the fetched data in the database.

It's mobile responsive and has passed the W3 css validation.
